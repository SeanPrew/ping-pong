#### By **Sean Prewitt**

## Description
This is a web application that displays a list of numbers i.e.  takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to a chosen number with exceptions of 3, 5 and 15 along with their multiples.

## How it works.
The program should return a message when input is not an number
- Input : a
- Output : Not a number

- Input : This is ping pong
- Output : Not a number

The program should count to the number provided by the user
- Input : 2
- Output : [1, 2]

The program should replace 3 and its multiples with ping
- Input : 11
- Output :  [1, 2, ping, 4, 5, ping, 7, 8, ping, 10, 11]

The program should replace 5 and its multiples with pong
- Input : 13
- Output :  [ 1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7, 8, ping, pong, 11, ping, 13]

The program should replace multiples of both 3 and 5 or 15 and its multiples with pingpong
- Input : 17
- Output :  [ 1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7, 8, ping, pong, 11, ping, 13, 14, pingpong, 16, 17]
